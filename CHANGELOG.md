# [2.0.0](https://github.com/martinheidegger/flexlock-cb/compare/v1.2.0...v2.0.0) (2019-03-05)


### Features

* handling sync calls like regular calls, with supports for callbacks and error handling. ([520f08a](https://github.com/martinheidegger/flexlock-cb/commit/520f08a))


### Performance Improvements

* improving callback performance while maintaining async behavior. ([59ef312](https://github.com/martinheidegger/flexlock-cb/commit/59ef312))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* this shouldnâ€™t break any common cases, but as the performance is quicker, it might break things that rely on that.
* The sync api expected errors to be sent to the onSyncError handler. This is not happening anymore which makes this a breaking change.
